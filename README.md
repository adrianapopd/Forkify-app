This is one of my dearest projects so far, where I included most of my JavaScript skills and knowledge. Using data from Forkify API, the application allows user to search a recipe based on ingredients or name. The user can also bookmark recipe that are stored in Local Storage on page reload. Also, the user can Create a Recipe, filling the specific form. The form data will be collected and displayed as a new Recipe that is automatically bookmarked as Own and only the user can see it, thanks to the own user Key provided by Forkisy API.
